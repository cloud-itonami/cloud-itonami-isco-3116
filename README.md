# cloud-itonami-isco-3116

Open Occupation Blueprint for **ISCO-08 3116**: Chemical Engineering Technicians.

This repository designs a forkable OSS system for lab testing and material analysis management: a lab test robot collects and records material analysis data under a governor-gated actor, so the batch maintains its own test records, safety logs, and audit ledger instead of managing paper or closed SaaS systems.

## Robotics premise

All cloud-itonami verticals are designed on the premise that a **robot performs
the physical domain work**. Here a lab test robot performs lab test data recording, material analysis logging, and batch documentation under an actor that proposes actions and an
independent **Chemical Engineering Governor** that gates them. The governor never dispatches
hardware itself; `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions (such as chemical hazard escalation,
or batch approval) require human sign-off.

A live sample of the operator console (robotics safety console, shared template) is
rendered in [docs/samples/operator-console.html](docs/samples/operator-console.html) —
pure-data HTML output of `kotoba.robotics.ui`.

## Core Contract

```text
material batch registration + baseline analysis + verification schedule
        |
        v
Test Advisor -> Chemical Eng Governor -> record/log, or human sign-off
        |
        v
robot actions (gated) + test records + audit ledger
```

No automated advice can dispatch a robot action the governor refuses, suppress
an operating record, or escalate a chemical hazard without governor approval and
audit evidence.

## Reference implementation (`:maturity :implemented`)

Full itonami Actor pattern (per ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md's Actors
section, alongside `cloud-itonami-isco-2411`, `-2161`, `-6130`, `-8160`,
`-2166`, `-2641`, `-2651`, `-2652`, `-2654`, `-1219`, `-1223`, `-1330`,
`-1341`, `-1349`, `-1412`, `-1439`, `-2144`, `-2320`, `-3112`, `-3113`, and `-3116`): a real
[`kotoba-lang/langgraph`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/langgraph)
`StateGraph`, with the Advisor and Governor as distinct graph nodes and
human-in-the-loop interrupt/resume via checkpointing.

```text
:intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                           +-> :request-approval   (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                           +-> :hold               (:hard? true)
```

- `src/chem/store.cljc` — `Store` protocol + `MemStore`:
  registered material batches, committed lab test/analysis records, an append-only audit ledger.
- `src/chem/advisor.cljc` — `Advisor` protocol; `mock-advisor`
  (deterministic, default) proposes a lab test/analysis operation from a request; `llm-advisor`
  wraps a `langchain.model/ChatModel` — either way the advisor only ever
  produces a `:propose`-effect proposal, never a committed record, and LLM parse
  failures always yield `confidence 0.0` (forces escalation, never fabricated confidence).
- `src/chem/governor.cljc` — `ChemGovernor/check`: a pure function,
  wired as its own `:govern` node. Hard invariants (unregistered batch,
  a proposal whose `:effect` isn't `:propose`) always route to `:hold`.
  Escalation invariants (`:flag-chemical-hazard` or low advisor confidence)
  always route to `:request-approval` — an `interrupt-before` node that the
  graph checkpoints and only resumes on explicit human approval (`actor/approve!`),
  matching the README's robotics-premise statement that chemical hazards
  always require human sign-off.
- `src/chem/actor.cljc` — `build-graph`, `run-request!`, `approve!`:
  the `langgraph.graph/state-graph` wiring itself.

```bash
clojure -M:test

[`kotoba-lang/occupation`](https://github.com/kotoba-lang/occupation) for ISCO-08 3116.
